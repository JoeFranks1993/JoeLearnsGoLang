** Public and Private Members **
aka. exported or non-exported methods are denoted by either starting with a capital letter or a lower case letter.
I.E 
func DoAThing() {} // This will be public and can be invoked by a package importing this package.
vs 
func doAThing() {} // This will be private and can only be invoked locally 

** Panic **
panic(msg) // Basically a way of saying, an error happened that we cannot recover from, there is nothing that can be done. 
This is used in the case where we cannot recover, other wise we would simply import errors and use the error interface as a return type to the caller.

** defer **
defer functionInvocation() // This acts similar to a finally {} in .net. You can use this syntax when you want to do something after the current function has completed.
I.E this will be exectuted once you leave the scope of the function that stated it.
A good example of this being a DB connection function. 
Connect to the DB, make your query and defer closeDbConnection()
